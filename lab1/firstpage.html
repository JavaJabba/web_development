            I am a first year Computer Science mature student in University college cork. I love all things computing and gaming.

        <h2>Education "The Journey".</h2>
        <p>
            I went to Mayfield Community School here in Cork City and I graduated back in 2015. 
            Once completing the leaving cert I attended CIT studying Biological and Chemical Sciences.
            This did not turn out to be the path I wanted and left after year one.
            I then worked for a year or two while decided what I wanted to do/study. 
            I realised that throughout my life I have always had a fascination with computers.
            Therefore, I started to study Computer Systems and Networks in Cork College of Commerce.
            I really enjoyed that course and realised that this is exactly what I wanted to do.
            I then attended a second year in Cork College of Commerce to study Software Development and 
            discovered that I really like the programming aspect of computer science.    
        </p>

            While at Cork College of Commerce, there was a new opportunity to progress into year three of a 
            Computer Science course in the Netherlands. This seemed like an interesting opportunity so I pursed it.
            After applying, being accepted and moving to Amsterdam, on my first day it seemed like I was enrolled in 
            first after previous confirmation that I was using said progression route. It turned out to be mass information 
            given to me and my previous college about the specifics and final details of the route. Therefore I returned home 
            to find another way of progressing on my desired path. Then salvation arrived in the form of a mature student entry 
            to Computer Science in UCC and here I am!
